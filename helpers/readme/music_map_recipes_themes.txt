Themes are 'tag containers' which emulate track's tags, to be used with
'Music Map' buttons and tools instead of evaluating with the
selected track.

Recipes are 'variables containers' which emulate the args of 'Search by
Distance' buttons and tools instead of using hard-coded variables or
properties.

Note recipes may also contain a forced theme, either the entire object or
a link to a theme file (using its path or filename).

Both may be used in buttons, tools or with Playlist Tools:
	- Playlist Tools's Pools can link to these files on some sources.
	- Custom buttons may use recipes and themes to tweak their behavior.
	- Basic buttons also show them at 'Other recipes' submenu.

Recipe files may be created via files or custom button:
	- On custom buttons, use the recipe menu (Ctrl + Left Click).
	- Otherwise, directly edit the JSON files at the recipes folder.

Theme files may be created via files or Music Map custom button:
	- On custom buttons, use the theme menu	(Shift + Left Click).
	- Otherwise, directly edit the JSON files at the themes folder.

Both type of files may be set to 'Hidden' (file attribute) to not show them
on the menus, instead of deleting them. Some files, meant for internal use
only, may be hidden by default.

Although all recipes are shown by default in a clean installation, it's
recommended to hide those which will not be used on a daily basis to clean
up the menu using the tip above.
