Asynchronous execution refers to the execution of some code done on the
background (usually on iterative steps) For ex. external playlist files
loading on native Foobar2000.

Enabling asynchronous processing for specific tools will not block the 
UI while executing them, allowing to continue using Foobar2000 without
interruptions, but as a side-effect they will also take more time to
finish.

Feature is only noticeable when processing a high number of tracks or
computationally heavy tasks.
